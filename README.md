# Cancer Center App Demo
Members: Anna Benson, Kevin Li, Georgia Tse

#### Project Purpose
The app will be designed for patients as well all as caretakers, family, and friends to use. The goal of the project is for the application to be straightforward to use, clean, and functional. Our project itself will not be used as the final version of the application, but as a prototype to be presented to a committee and then developed further. The application will hopefully allow patients to utilize the existing services of the center with greater ease and receive immediate updates about wait times, events, and scheduling changes.
